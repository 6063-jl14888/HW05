In this context, we attempted to visualize data using icons or graphics.

I chose the dataset "Motor Vehicle Collisions" as my base data. While reading through this data, I noticed that it contained latitude and longitude information, and these numerical values were similar to the coordinate system we established on our canvas â€“ they were both distributed in a grid-like pattern. Therefore, longitude, latitude and the number of zip code from the data became my choice for visualization images.

I used the coordinates of longitude and latitude to determine the position of circles, which I displayed on the screen. Since longitude and latitude contain complex numbers, I had to move the canvas's origin to the appropriate position. And also the diameter of the circle is the number of zipcode

The most challenging part for me was figuring out how to get these circular coordinates to appear on the screen, as the sheer volume of data often led to issues with data not displaying correctly.

However, I'm having trouble changing the stroke color effectively. I'd like it to create a color gradient as the position of the circle changes.
